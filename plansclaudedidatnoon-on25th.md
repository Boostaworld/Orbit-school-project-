      **CONTEXT FROM EXPLORATION:**

       **Current Brutal Reality:**
       1. **Intel Command Deck** - Beautiful UI but NOT WIRED to AI backend (simulated responses). The backend exists in `lib/ai/intel.ts` with essay generation capability, but frontend just shows fake
       responses.
       2. **Task Board** - Just tracks tasks, doesn't break them down or award points for completion
       3. **The Vault** - Works as a homework marketplace (ethically questionable - enables copying)
       4. **Racing** - Immersive experience but no point rewards, no multiplayer betting, no stakes
       5. **Economy** - Passive mining works, shop works, but disconnected from actual gameplay
       6. **The Loop** - Tasks don't earn points, races don't earn points, features are isolated

       **What Actually Works:**
       - Passive miner (1pt/min, 5min cooldown)
       - Shop purchases (themes, cursors, AI model unlocks)
       - DMs with real-time presence
       - Constellation Map for social discovery
       - Racing against bots (visual polish is excellent)

       ## YOUR MISSION:

       Create a comprehensive strategic plan with TWO parts:

       ### PART 1: THE DEEP LOGIC AUDIT

       Critique Orbit OS through the lens of a high school student who switches between:
       - **PANIC MODE:** "I have 1 hour to finish this essay"
       - **ROT MODE:** "Work is done, I'm bored in class"

       Answer these questions brutally honestly:

       1. **THE PANIC CHECK:**
          - Does Intel actually WRITE my essay or just give advice?
          - Can I copy-paste from The Vault and turn it in?
          - Does the Oracle solve my math homework or just motivate me?
          - **Reality check:** If I have 60 minutes before deadline, does Orbit save me or waste my time?

       2. **THE BOREDOM CHECK:**
          - If I finish homework in 20 minutes, why stay in Orbit for 60 more?
          - Is racing fun enough to repeat 10 times?
          - Are DMs better than Discord/Snap?
          - **Reality check:** Would I close Orbit or stay to "hang out"?

       3. **THE LOOP ANALYSIS:**
          - Do features feed each other? (Can I bet homework-earned points on races?)
          - Is there a flywheel effect? (More play → More points → Better tools → Easier homework → More play?)
          - **Reality check:** Is this a cohesive game or separate tools?

       4. **THE SOCIAL GLUE:**
          - DMs exist, but DMs are boring. What makes hanging out in Orbit better than Discord?
          - Constellation Map shows online friends, but then what?
          - **Reality check:** What's the "digital recess" experience?

       5. **CONSTRAINT CHECK:**
          - Discard features requiring 50+ users (no critical mass yet)
          - Focus on asynchronous utility (works alone)
          - Micro-multiplayer (1v1 or small squads)
          - **Reality check:** What works with 5 friends online?

       ### PART 2: THE VISIONARY EXPANSION

       Design **3 NEW KILLER FEATURES** that pass the "High School Reasoning Engine":

       **THE GENIUS TRIGGER (Lateral Thinking):**
       - Connect unrelated concepts (Homework + RPG Classes = "The Heist")
       - Example combinations: Music + Typing, Betting + Study Groups, AI + Status Symbols

       **THE 4 MANDATORY FILTERS (Every feature must pass ALL):**

       1. **LAZY GENIUS TEST:** Does this help me do LESS work? (Cheat code factor)
       2. **ALT-TAB UTILITY:** Can I use this in class without getting caught? Does it look "productive" from afar?
       3. **STATUS FACTOR:** Does this give me social currency to flex on friends? (Points/skins/leaderboards)
       4. **VIBE FACTOR:** Is this fun when I'm just bored and messing around?

       **THE MANDATE:**
       1. **Weaponize Productivity** → Turn essays into "combos" (gamified writing)
       2. **Gamify Social** → Turn networking into "live hangouts" (digital recess)
       3. **Enhance Intelligence** → Turn homework into "operations" (AI-guided execution)

       ## OUTPUT FORMAT:

       Structure your response as:

       ```markdown
       ## PART 1: DEEP LOGIC AUDIT

       ### 1. THE PANIC CHECK (Deadline in 1 hour)
       [Brutal assessment of each tool]
       **VERDICT:** [Does Orbit actually help or waste time?]

       ### 2. THE BOREDOM CHECK (Work done, 60 mins to kill)
       [Honest assessment of "hang out" value]
       **VERDICT:** [Would I stay or leave?]

       ### 3. THE LOOP ANALYSIS
       [Current state of feature interconnection]
       **GAPS IDENTIFIED:** [What's missing?]

       ### 4. THE SOCIAL GLUE
       [What makes Orbit > Discord?]
       **RECOMMENDATION:** [How to fix this?]

       ### 5. CONSTRAINT-BASED PRIORITIES
       [What works with 5 friends?]

       ## PART 2: VISIONARY EXPANSION

       ### KILLER FEATURE #1: [Name]
       **CONCEPT:** [What is it?]
       **GENIUS TRIGGER:** [What unrelated concepts merged?]
       **MECHANICS:** [How does it work?]
       **FILTER RESULTS:**
       - ✅ Lazy Genius: [Explanation]
       - ✅ Alt-Tab Utility: [Explanation]
       - ✅ Status Factor: [Explanation]
       - ✅ Vibe Factor: [Explanation]
       **IMPLEMENTATION:** [Technical approach]

       ### KILLER FEATURE #2: [Name]
       [Same structure]

       ### KILLER FEATURE #3: [Name]
       [Same structure]

       ---

       ## STRATEGIC PRIORITIES

       1. [Critical fixes to existing features]
       2. [New feature implementation order]
       3. [Risk mitigation strategies]
       ```

       Be BRUTALLY HONEST. If something doesn't work, say it. If Orbit is just a cool UI with hollow features, call it out. Think like a cynical high school senior who's seen every "productivity app" fail.

       Use the exploration data I provided above. Reference specific code files when making claims.
