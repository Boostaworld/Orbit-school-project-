  🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES

  1. Typography Weakness
    - Using generic system fonts throughout
    - No distinctive character or hierarchy
    - Missing that "terminal hacker" personality
  2. Color Monotony
    - Everything is cyan/violet - no visual distinction between features
    - Economy should feel golden/valuable
    - Intel should feel data-driven (blue)
    - Training should feel energetic (different accent)
  3. Flat Backgrounds
    - Missing depth, grain, scanlines, glitch effects
    - No atmospheric "space station terminal" vibe
  4. Weak Micro-interactions
    - Buttons lack satisfying feedback
    - No hover surprises or delightful moments
    - Missing sound/haptic feel in interactions

  🎯 IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY

  I'll systematically enhance each component with:

  1. Distinctive Typography - Add JetBrains Mono for code, Orbitron for headers
  2. Feature-Specific Color Coding - Economy=Gold, Intel=Blue, Training=Purple, Social=Cyan
  3. Atmospheric Backgrounds - Noise textures, scanlines, glitch effects, gradient meshes
  4. Enhanced Motion - Staggered reveals, hover surprises, page transition effects
  5. Micro-interactions - Button feedback, loading states, success celebrations

  Let me now systematically improve each component:
